=======

To reduce compilation complexity, this project mimics an Example API application as published in the official ARDrone API. To build this project, clone this repository to:

./ARDrone_SDK_Version_1_8_20110726/Examples/Linux

where "ARDrone_SDK_Version..." is the directory of the latest ARDrone API[1] installed on your computer. 

To build, navigate to 

./ARDrone_SDK_Version_1_8_20110726/Examples/Linux/Build

and execute

$ sudo make

The make script will install the binary "work_sdk" to 

./ARDrone_SDK_Version_1_8_20110726/Examples/Linux/Build/Release/

Execute the program in the terminal.

$ ./work_sdk
