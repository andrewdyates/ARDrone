\section{Abstract}
We propose to fly a toy quadrotor using machine vision techniques
introduced in class. The toy quadrotor includes a 320 by 240 pixel
color web cam and a Linux wireless network interface by which we may
receive the web cam video feed and send simple flight commands from a
laptop computer. The quadrotor is small, safe, and stable enough to be
flown in class, but we will also prepare work based on recorded video
in the case that the quadrotor fails unexpectedly.

\section{Proposal One}
We propose to track and follow a green object in flight for three
minutes. To achieve this, we expect to use background subtraction,
simple threshold object detection, noise filtering, moment
calculation, motion detection, and object tracking. The quadrotor
will attempt to keep the green object in the center of its view at a
stable distance and will compensate for the angular tilt and
instability as the quadrotor pitches, rolls, and drifts. When the
quadrotor does not detect the green object in the upright position,
it will hover in place.

\section{Proposal Two}
Extending the successful completion of Proposal One, rather than track
an object, we propose to track and follow the face of one of the three
team members. When the quadrotor fails to recognize the face presented
in its camera, then the quadrotor will hover in place.
